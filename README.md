# Improving the Region Model in a Destination Recommender System Destination Finder (DestiRec)

## Introduction
The "Destination Finder," also referred to as [DestiRec](https://desti-rec.netlify.app), is a tourist region recommendation system. DestiRec allows users to adjust their preferences and adapts recommendations in response to user preference modifications instantly. The system immediately updates its recommendations by acknowledging regional attributes and individual preferences. These updated recommendations are subsequently displayed on the map panel and presented as the top 10 best-matching results. DestiRec allows users to specify their travel budget, activity preferences, and their preferred travel months.

The objective of this study is to enhance the DestiRec application's regional model by gathering additional data and incorporating it into the existing DestiRec application. Further user study will be conducted to determine whether these modifications result in significant changes in user preferences during destination selection. Data is gathered using knowledge graphs such as DBpedia, maps such as OpenStreetMap, and various websites.

## Python Notebook Overview
This Python notebook presents the process of gathering, processing, and incorporating additional data into the existing DestiRec data model. The notebook outlines the following main steps:

1. **Data Gathering**: Utilizing various sources such as knowledge graphs (e.g., DBpedia), maps (e.g., OpenStreetMap), and websites to collect additional data relevant to tourist regions.
2. **Data Processing**: Cleaning, organizing, and preprocessing the gathered data to ensure compatibility with the existing DestiRec data model.
3. **Data Incorporation**: Integrating the processed data into the existing DestiRec application's regional model to enhance recommendation accuracy and relevance.
